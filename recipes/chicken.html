    <p>
        we've been looking for the 'perfect' coating for
        chicken and just couldn't seem to find the one. We've made this one our own
        and love it! We make some seasoned flour, (use plenty of black pepper and a touch
        of cayenne and a little garlic salt) dip the chicken in that first then in the egg
        and then in the cracker mixture. This way the coating stays on really well. And we like
        good and brown. Our favorite is skinless boneless chicken thighs.
        It's good the next day too if you are lucky enough to have any left over.
